# üìä Beejan Technologies ‚Äì Conceptual End-to-End Data Pipeline

## üìå Business Problem
Beejan Technologies receives thousands of customer complaints daily (poor network, incorrect billing, bad customer service).  
Data comes in through **different channels**:  
- Social media posts  
- Call center log files  
- SMS messages  
- Website forms  
- Legacy files (CSV, Excel, emails)  

Challenges faced:
- Data scattered across formats and channels  
- Manual spreadsheet compilation  
- No unified pipeline ‚Üí delayed reports & siloed teams  

The goal is to **design a conceptual end-to-end data pipeline** to centralize, clean, enrich, and make this data actionable.

## üèóÔ∏è Conceptual Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of **five main stages** plus orchestration & governance.

### **1. Sources**
- **Social Media**: Posts, mentions, DMs (Streaming + periodic pull)  
- **Call Center Logs**: Structured/semi-structured logs (Batch + near-real-time)  
- **SMS**: Short text payloads (Streaming)  
- **Web Forms**: Complaint form submissions (Near-real-time events)  
- **Other Files**: CSV, Excel, Emails (Batch uploads)  

### **2. Ingestion Layer**
- Connectors for APIs, file drops, message gateways  
- Schema-on-read capture with metadata tagging  
- Backpressure and buffering for bursts  
- Idempotent, replayable intake  

### **3. Processing & Enrichment**
- Standardize encodings, timestamps, PII masking  
- Normalize fields (customer_id, channel, region)  
- Deduplicate, spell-correct, language detect  
- Complaint classification & priority scoring  
- Entity linking (customer, account, product)  
- Quality checks & anomaly detection  

### **4. Storage**
- Raw zone (immutable), curated zone (cleaned), serving zone (modeled)  
- Time-partitioned layouts; ACID-like semantics conceptually  
- Columnar formats for analytics, compacted event logs for streams  
- Governed access with lineage, versioning, retention  

### **5. Serving & Access**
- Ad-hoc exploratory queries  
- Semantic models (business-ready datasets)  
- Operational APIs & real-time alert feeds  
- Dashboards & scheduled reports  
- Data products for downstream analytics & churn prediction  

### **Side Controls**
- **Orchestration & Monitoring (Left Side)**  
  - Schedules & triggers  
  - Health checks, SLAs  
  - Alerting & incident management  
  - Cost & usage tracking  

- **Security & Governance (Right Side)**  
  - Access control  
  - Lineage & audit  
  - Data quality rules  
  - Privacy & compliance  

---

## üìù Design Choices
- Separation of **raw, curated, and serving layers** for lineage and flexibility  
- **Streaming-first** for high-impact channels (social, SMS, web)  
- **Batch ingestion** for historical/log data to save cost  
- **Modular classification pipeline** to handle taxonomy changes  
- Governance (masking, lineage, compliance) included from the start  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Unknowns
- Aligning on **final complaint taxonomy** with stakeholders  
- **PII handling** rules (minimization, lawful basis, retention)  
- **Source variability** (social APIs, log formats may change)  
- **Identity resolution** across channels (phone/email/social handle conflicts)  
- **Traffic surges** during outages ‚Äî need buffering and graceful degradation  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Validate data contracts & sample payloads with each channel owner  
2. Finalize complaint taxonomy and service SLAs  
3. Draft governance policies (PII, retention, access)  
4. Create data quality & classification test cases  
5. Define monitoring, alerting, and escalation paths

1. **Top row**: 5 source boxes (Social Media, Call Center Logs, SMS, Web Forms, Other Files)  
2. **Arrows downward** from sources ‚Üí Ingestion Layer  
3. **Ingestion Layer box** below sources (wide)  
4. Arrow downward ‚Üí **Processing & Enrichment box** (wide)  
5. Arrow downward ‚Üí **Storage box** (wide)  
6. Arrow downward ‚Üí **Serving & Access box** (wide, bottom)  
7. **Left side vertical box**: Orchestration & Monitoring (aligned to Processing ‚Üí Serving)  
8. **Right side vertical box**: Security & Governance (aligned to Processing ‚Üí Serving)

This is a **conceptual blueprint** only. No tools or technologies are specified, so it can be adapted with any modern data engineering stack.
